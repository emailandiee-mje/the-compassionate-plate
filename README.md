# The Compassionate Plate 🌱
**Data Visualization Project | SQL & Google Cloud Platform**

### Project Overview
This project explores the environmental impact of food production, specifically comparing the carbon footprint and water usage of animal-based vs. plant-based foods.

### The Tech Stack
* **Data Warehouse:** Google BigQuery
* **Transformation:** SQL (Custom CASE logic for dietary categorization)
* **Visualization:** Looker Studio (Interactive Dashboard)
* **Data Source:** Poore, J., & Nemecek, T. (2018). *Reducing food’s environmental impacts through producers and consumers*. Science.

### Key Insights
* **Carbon Impact:** Animal-based products generate ~6x more emissions on average than plant-based options.
* **Resource Use:** While some plant crops (like Rice and Nuts) have high water needs, they generally remain far lower in overall environmental cost compared to Beef and Lamb.
